# Frontend Design

This skill guides creation of distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic aesthetics. Implement real working code with exceptional attention to details and creative choices.

## Design Thinking

Before coding, define a bold aesthetic direction:
- Purpose: What problem does this interface solve? Who uses it?
- Tone: Pick an extreme and commit (e.g., brutalist/raw, luxury/refined, editorial/magazine, retro-futuristic, soft/pastel, industrial/utilitarian).
- Constraints: Framework, performance, accessibility, and any technical requirements.
- Differentiation: What makes this unforgettable? Identify the one memorable element.

Critical: Choose a clear conceptual direction and execute it with precision. Intentionality matters more than intensity.

## Implementation Requirements

Deliver working code (HTML/CSS/JS, React, Vue, etc.) that is:
- Production-grade and functional
- Visually striking and cohesive with a clear point-of-view
- Meticulously refined in typography, spacing, and motion
- Accessible, performant, and maintainable

## Frontend Aesthetics Guidelines

Focus on:
- Typography: Choose beautiful, characterful fonts. Avoid generic defaults (Arial, Inter, Roboto). Pair a distinctive display font with a refined body font.
- Color & Theme: Commit to a cohesive palette. Use CSS variables. Prefer dominant colors with sharp accents over timid, evenly spread palettes.
- Motion: Use animations for high-impact moments. Favor CSS-only for HTML. In React, prefer Motion libraries if available. Orchestrate page-load reveals; use scroll-triggered and hover states judiciously.
- Spatial Composition: Explore unexpected layouts—asymmetry, overlap, diagonal flow, generous negative space or controlled density.
- Backgrounds & Visual Details: Build atmosphere and depth—gradient meshes, noise textures, geometric patterns, layered transparencies, dramatic shadows, decorative borders, custom cursors, grain overlays.

Never default to generic AI-generated aesthetics (overused fonts, purple-on-white gradients, predictable layouts). Interpret context creatively and vary themes across projects; do not converge on the same font/color choices.

Important: Match implementation complexity to the aesthetic vision. Maximalist designs need elaborate code and effects. Minimalist designs need restraint and precision.

## Usage

Invoke this skill when:
- Building or styling any web UI: components, pages, apps, dashboards, posters, or landing pages
- Elevating an existing interface to production-grade quality
- Designing for specific audiences with clear tone and differentiation

## Deliverables Checklist

- Clear aesthetic direction documented (purpose, tone, differentiation)
- Code that runs locally with no errors
- Consistent design tokens (CSS variables for colors, spacing, typography)
- Accessible interactions (keyboard focus states, contrast, ARIA where needed)
- Performance-conscious choices (optimized assets, prudent animation)

## Examples

- Brutalist editorial landing page with oversized typography, stark contrast, and asymmetric layout
- Refined minimal SaaS dashboard with quiet micro-interactions, strong grid discipline, and typographic hierarchy
- Retro-futuristic portfolio with mesh gradients, noise overlays, and playful hover states

## Notes

- Maintain code quality: modular components, clear naming, minimal external dependencies unless needed
- Keep animations purposeful: limit simultaneous motions; prefer staged reveals
